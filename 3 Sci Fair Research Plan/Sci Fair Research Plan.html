<h1>Research Plan Instructions</h1>

<p><strong>Write a research plan.</strong> The plan should include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Question or problem</li>
    <li>Goals/expected outcomes/hypotheses</li>
    <li>Methods or procedures</li>
    <li>Types of data to be collected and how it will be analyzed</li>
    <li>Bibliography (at least five major references)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Detailed Research Plan Instructions</h2>
<p>
    Write and submit the research plan and approval form with parent/guardian signatures for teacher approval. Consult teachers, other adults, or scientists who might help you. Get additional forms signed and approved as needed.
</p>

<h2>Research Plan Requirements</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Provide a brief background on your research problem, its importance, and any potential societal impact.</li>
    <li><strong>Research Question, Hypothesis, Goals, and Expected Outcomes:</strong> Explain how your goals are based on the rationale described above.</li>
    <li><strong>Procedures:</strong> Detail all procedures and experimental designs, including methods for data collection. Focus only on your project; do not include work done by others.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk and Safety:</strong> Identify potential risks and safety precautions.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Describe how you will analyze the data or results.</li>
    <li><strong>Bibliography:</strong> List at least five major references, such as science journal articles, books, and websites.</li>
</ol>

<h3>1. Human Participants Research</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Participants:</strong> Describe age range, gender, and racial/ethnic composition. Identify vulnerable populations (e.g., minors, pregnant women, prisoners, economically disadvantaged).</li>
    <li><strong>Recruitment:</strong> Where will participants be found? How will they be invited?</li>
    <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Describe what participants will be asked to do, including surveys, questionnaires, and testing frequency and duration.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Identify risks such as physical, psychological, social, or legal discomfort. Explain how risks will be minimized and list potential benefits.</li>
    <li><strong>Protection of Privacy:</strong> Explain how personal information will be kept confidential or anonymous. Describe data storage, access, and disposal plans.</li>
    <li><strong>Informed Consent:</strong> Describe how participants will be informed about the study, including their right to withdraw at any time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Vertebrate Animal Research</h3>

    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Discuss alternatives to using vertebrate animals and justify their use.</li>
    <li><strong>Research Impact:</strong> Explain the potential impact or contribution of your research.</li>
    <li><strong>Procedures:</strong> Detail procedures, minimizing discomfort, pain, or injury. Include chemical concentrations and drug dosages if applicable.</li>
    <li><strong>Animal Details:</strong> Provide details such as animal species, strain, age, and source. Justify the planned number of animals.</li>
    <li><strong>Care and Housing:</strong> Describe daily care, housing conditions, and plans for animals at the end of the study.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Potentially Hazardous Biological Agents Research</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Source of Organism:</strong> Identify the organism source and describe the Biosafety Level (BSL) assessment and determination.</li>
    <li><strong>Safety Precautions:</strong> Detail safety protocols and disposal methods.</li>
</ul>
